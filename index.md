1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
The utilization of graph machine learning in chip design. I liked learning about embeddings and representations of chip design graphs being applied to problems within chip design like congestion and timing. 
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
The ability to train a graph neural network and embeddings on millions of data points. Specifically, we would like to investigate how we can partition our dataset in batches to make it easier to train.
3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
We learned about contrastive learning today in class which might be useful in our batching process. This is because we are learning which embeddings are similar and which are not. This can be used to sample a batch as we want diverse information from different types of embeddings.
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
I would be interested in learning how to apply parallel learning and optimize the GPU to help decrease training and processing time within graph machine learning. I think along with batches will help reduce the time needed to train a graph neural network.
